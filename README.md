# Analyzing U.S. Reddit Discussions on Whether FPS Games Lead to Violent Tendencies in Adolescents

## Abstract

This project explores the relationship between first-person shooter (FPS) games and adolescent aggression by analyzing discussions from Reddit communities. Using data collected from subreddits like r/gaming, r/parenting, and r/teenagers, the study employs two key methods: Sentiment Analysis and Word Frequency Analysis. Sentiment analysis, conducted with VADER, reveals community-specific emotional tones—gamers express positivity, parents exhibit mixed views, and teenagers lean toward negative sentiments. Word frequency analysis identifies recurring themes such as "violence," "media," and "social," reflecting broader societal concerns.

The findings challenge the simplistic notion that FPS games directly contribute to violent tendencies in adolescents. Instead, discussions reflect a nuanced interplay of gaming’s benefits, external societal influences, and community perspectives. This project underscores the importance of balanced discourse, providing actionable insights for parents, educators, and policymakers to navigate the complex relationship between gaming and youth behavior.
